TO GET GENERAL PORT LIST (NO LINKING INFORMATION)
========================================================
	SELECT id, name, label, l2address, iif_id, (SELECT iif_name FROM PortInnerInterface WHERE id = iif_id) AS iif_name, (SELECT name FROM RackObject WHERE Port.object_id = RackObject.id) AS object_name, type AS oif_id, (SELECT dict_value FROM Dictionary WHERE dict_key = type) AS oif_name, reservation_comment FROM Port WHERE object_id = '5'

	object_id is rackobject id


TO LOOK UP IF LINKS EXIST FOR EACH PORT NUMBER: 
====================================================
	Select porta, portb, cable from Link where porta = '173' or portb = '173'


TO FIND OUT WHICH Rackobject a port is linked to 
================================================
SELECT name, object_id FROM Port WHERE id = '2663'

 	name 	object_id
	Gi1/17 	2



SQL To try to include details for any port that is linked.

SELECT id, name, label, l2address, (SELECT name FROM RackObject WHERE Port.object_id = RackObject.id) AS object_name, (SELECT dict_value FROM Dictionary WHERE dict_key = type) AS oif_name, reservation_comment, lnk.porta, lnk.portb
FROM Port 
LEFT JOIN Link lnk ON lnk.porta = id or lnk.portb =id
WHERE object_id = 5



** modified the above sql so that it doesn't just return porta or portb.  Returning the rack object names so that you can then determine if it's a switch or not. 
If it's linked to a switch, then you want to disable that port, or exclude it from the GUI so the users cannot accidentally kill a trunk.
